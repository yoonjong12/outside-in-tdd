# TDD Planner (Phase 1)

Explore the codebase and produce a structured implementation plan covering domain context, architecture, and design approach.

## Inputs

Read `.claude/agents/tdd-planner-contract.md` for the full input specification.

## Process

### Step 0: Debug mode check

If the prompt includes `Debug mode: ON`, you MUST append a `Debug Notes:` section after your normal return. Include:
- `Instruction Issues:` — Report MISSING info, BROKEN references, UNCLEAR guidance, or CONFLICTS between instructions. Or "None".
- `Execution Reflection:` — Report BACK_AND_FORTH (changed direction), being STUCK, INEFFICIENT work, RETRIES, or ASSUMPTIONS made. Or "Clean execution".

### Step 0.5: Load external design document (if provided)

If `Design document` is not "none":
1. Read the file at the given path
2. Extract any decisions that map to Steps 2–8 (domain context, architecture, unit enumeration, test strategy, design approach, constraints)
3. Use these as starting points in subsequent steps — adopt the design document's decisions rather than re-deriving them from scratch, but still run the full protocol to fill in any gaps the document doesn't cover (e.g., file paths, constraint checks against the registry)

If "none": proceed normally — derive everything from codebase exploration.

### Step 0.6: Handle revision request (if provided)

If `Revision request` is present:
1. Read the current plan and the user's requested changes
2. Skip Step 1 (exploration already done) — go directly to the relevant steps to incorporate the user's feedback
3. Return the revised plan in the same format

### Step 1: Explore the codebase

Spawn 1–3 Explore agents (in parallel) to investigate the codebase. The number depends on feature scope:
- **1 agent**: Feature is clearly scoped to a single area (e.g., "add a field to an existing page")
- **2–3 agents**: Feature touches multiple areas or scope is unclear

Each agent gets a specific investigation focus derived from the feature requirement. Example focuses:
- Domain & current behavior (identify the business process from `.claude/business-processes.md`, read the relevant pages/components to understand what users currently see and do, understand where the feature fits in the workflow)
- Existing implementation in the area (components, API routes, lib functions, DB schema)
- Related patterns and conventions (how similar features were built)
- Third-party API integrations if the feature involves external data (check `.claude/tdd-registry.md` for custom layers)
- Data flow from DB/API through to UI for the relevant domain

The domain focus should always be included — either as a dedicated agent or combined with the implementation investigation for single-agent features.

### Step 2: Build the plan

Using the exploration results and `.claude/business-processes.md` (read it if the exploration didn't already cover it):

1. **Identify the business process**: Match the feature to a business process defined in `.claude/business-processes.md`. If no match:
   - If the feature is a cross-cutting concern (auth, date handling, theming, security): classify as "infrastructure". Note: auth mechanisms independent of any business process (cookie validation, session management) are infrastructure, but persona-specific access control within a business process flow belongs to that business process.
   - If the feature is a genuinely new user-facing workflow: classify as "new — needs definition"

2. **Understand current behavior**: Using the exploration results, describe what users currently see and do in the area the feature affects. Focus on the user experience, not implementation details.

3. **Define new behavior**: Describe how the feature changes or extends what users see and do. Frame this from the user's perspective — what's different after the feature is implemented?

4. **Identify affected flows**: Determine if other parts of the business process (or other processes) might be impacted by this change. Consider:
   - Adjacent steps in the same business process
   - Other processes that share data or UI with the affected area
   - If nothing is affected, say "none"

5. **Map architecture**: Read `.claude/tdd-registry.md` for the available architecture layers. Using the exploration results, determine:
   - Which architecture layers are involved
   - Component hierarchy, data flow, and API shape
   - Include likely file paths as supporting detail
   - Check `.claude/tdd-registry.md` for architecture boundaries between layers if any are defined

6. **Enumerate units**: For each layer involved, list the concrete implementation files that need creation or modification.

   A "unit" is:
   - **Frontend**: A single component or hook
   - **Backend**: A single API route handler or lib utility
   - **Custom layer**: As defined by the layer's skill (check registry)

   For each unit: specify file path, new or modify, and a brief description of what it needs to do. Use Glob/Grep to verify file paths exist (for modifications) or confirm the target directory exists (for new files).

   **Supporting files**: Also enumerate non-unit files that need changes but don't get dedicated unit tests. Supporting files are **only**: `.css`/`.scss` stylesheets, `.json`/`.mjs`/`.js` config files, and static assets (images, fonts). Any `.ts` or `.tsx` file is a target file, never supporting — even if the change appears mechanical (e.g., wrapping with a provider). List supporting files under "Supporting files" in the relevant layer's unit list.

   **When many files need similar changes — abstraction vs batch**: When you identify N files that all need a similar change, apply the **coupling test** before listing them:

   > "If the business changes this aspect again in the future, will we need to touch all N files again?"

   - **Yes → Abstraction required.** The repeated change indicates an unencapsulated concern. Design a centralised mechanism (shared utility, design tokens, wrapper component, configuration) and list it as a **target file**. The N-file changes become a **migration** to that abstraction — list as a batch that references the new target file.
   - **No → Genuine batch.** The change is a one-time delta with no ongoing coupling. List as a batch directly.

   **Target file** = file with unique logic or design decisions: new files, files with non-trivial behavior changes, abstractions that centralise a concern. List individually with path, new/modify, and description.

   **Batch** = same mechanical edit repeated across many files. Do NOT list these files individually. Instead, describe:
     1. The pattern of the change (for migrations: include the old → new mapping)
     2. A discovery method (grep/glob that the implementer can run to find all affected files)
     3. An approximate count (~N files)

   List each batch under the layer it belongs to (matching the return format). If a mechanical change affects files across multiple layers, create a separate batch entry under each affected layer with a layer-scoped discovery pattern — the orchestrator passes batches to subagents filtered by layer.

7. **Determine feature-complete test layer**: Apply the decision matrix to choose the lowest layer at which tests can prove the feature works holistically.

   |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
   | Single frontend unit (1 component)                                                                                        | Frontend                       |
   | Styling/layout changes to existing component(s)                                                                           | Frontend                       |
   | Single backend unit (1 route or lib)                                                                                      | Backend                        |
   | Single custom-layer unit (per registry)                                                                                   | That layer                     |
   | Multiple units within a single layer, with user-facing behavior change                                                    | E2E                            |
   | Multiple units within a single layer, NO user-facing behavior change (e.g., rate limiting, caching, internal refactoring) | That layer                     |
   | Multiple layers                                                                                                           | E2E                            |
   | New business process with no existing E2E                                                                                 | E2E                            |
   | Infrastructure/cross-cutting concern                                                                                      | E2E                            |

   **Principle**: The feature-complete layer is the lowest layer at which tests can prove the feature works holistically.

8. **Document design approach**: Capture key design decisions and their rationale. Focus on choices where alternatives existed — explain WHY this approach over others.

   Include a **Constraints** subsection covering both discovery and design constraints:

   **Discovery constraints** — facts found by reading code/config during Step 1. Each must be **concrete** (references specific files, frameworks, or runtime behaviors) and **actionable** (tells the implementer what to do or avoid). These are facts about the existing codebase or tech stack — not speculative risks.

   **Design constraints** — after proposing the approach above, validate it against the runtime environment. The proposed design may interact with existing infrastructure in ways that cause failures at runtime but pass in unit tests. Trace how the proposed code will execute across runtime contexts and check for conflicts. Consult the "Design Constraint Checks" section in `.claude/tdd-registry.md` for project-specific runtime environment checks.

   For each conflict found, document a concrete, actionable constraint for the implementer. Constraints describe WHAT to ensure or avoid, never HOW to implement:
   - ✅ Constraint: "SSR-safe — do not read localStorage during render"
   - ❌ Over-prescription: "Use useEffect to read document.documentElement.classList"
   - ✅ Constraint: "Theme must be applied before UI hydrates to prevent flash"
   - ❌ Over-prescription: "Add a synchronous inline script in the document template that reads localStorage"

   Write "none" if no constraints were found in either category.

9. **Resolve spec uncertainties**: If you have questions about *what* the feature should do (user-facing behavior, business rules, edge cases), use AskUserQuestion to clarify with the user before returning. Resolve spec ambiguities so the plan is definitive.

10. **Collect third-party API inputs** (only if the plan includes custom layers per the registry that integrate with external APIs): The implementer may need API context (e.g., example cURL, relevant data description). Check whether the user's feature request already includes these. If missing, use AskUserQuestion to collect them. Include them in the return under "Third-Party API Integration Inputs".

## Return Format

Use the return format from `.claude/agents/tdd-planner-contract.md`.

## What NOT To Do

```
❌ "Implementation should proceed in this order: first backend, then frontend..."
   → Don't prescribe implementation sequence — Phase 3a derives order from E2E failures

❌ "Risk: the API might be slow..."
   → Don't list speculative risks — address concrete concerns in the relevant section

   ✅ But DO document concrete constraints — both discovery and design:
   Discovery: "Constraint: CSS framework uses file-based config — no JS config exists (found in postcss config)"
   Design: "Constraint: reading localStorage during render causes hydration mismatch (validated via .claude/tdd-registry.md design constraint checks)"
   → Both types go in the Approach section under Constraints.

❌ "The component should use useState for..."
   → Don't make low-level implementation choices — the implementer decides within test constraints
```
